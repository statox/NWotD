# Nasa Wallpaper of the Day ðŸš€

Set the [Nasa Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) as your wallpaper, zoom background and Teams background!

## Requirements

This script is made to run on Linux. Tested only on Ubuntu >= `24.04` with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) >= `4.23`

- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) Used to parse the APOD API output. Could probably be replaced by a simple regex but eh ðŸ¤·
- (Optional) [`feh`](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) Used to set up the desktop wallpaper. For now this is only tested on i3, for Gnome `man feh` recommends using `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///path` instead.
- (Optional) [`zoom`](https://zoom.us/) This program can change the virtual background you use on zoom
- (Optional)(Experimental) [`teams-for-linux`](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux) This program can change the virtual background you use on Teams. **This is highly experimental, refer to [`./teams/README.md`](./teams/README.md) for more details.**

## Installation

1. Clone the repo and run the `post-install.sh` script. The script will add a line to the current user's crontab to run NWotD every hour.
1. Change the config in `index.sh`
    1. `WALLPAPER_DIR` must be an existing directory. Last downloaded wallpapers are stored there.
    1. `ZOOM_BACKGROUND_PATH` is the path to the virtual background file in zoom. You need to set a virtual background through the application first to create the image with a random name. Use this random name in the variable.

## Startup configuration

With i3 you can configure the script to run on start up by adding the following line in your `$HOME/.config/i3/config` file:

```
exec_always --no-startup-id /path/to/NWotD/index.sh -w >> /var/log/nwotd.log 2>&1
```

## Usage

The script supports some parameter to tweak its actions:

- `-f` (`force`) By default the script doesn't run if `$TODAY_WP_PATH` is less than 12h old, `-f` prevents that
- `-z` (`zoom`) Update the `$ZOOM_BACKGROUND_PATH` file
- `-w` (`wallpaper`) Update the wallpaper with `feh`
